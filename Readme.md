# Pong with OpenGL and C++

Based on [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com) tutorials, using [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) for multiplatform window and opengl context initialization, [glad](http://glad.dav1d.de/) for OpengGL loading, [STB Image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) for image loading and [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for 3D mathematics.

CMake is used to create the build and in the `.vscode` directory there are some configuration files to setup the development enviroment in Visual Studio Code.
